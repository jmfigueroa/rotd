## ROTD Periodic Review: July 3, 2025

### ✅ Artifact Health
- All core files present: tasks.jsonl, test_summaries/, lessons_learned.jsonl, pss_scores.jsonl
- 3 tasks lack `pss_scores` entries: 4.1, 6.3, 7.2
- `lessons_learned.jsonl` last updated 2 days ago

### 🧠 ROTD Compliance
- All completed tasks have test summaries ✓
- Task 6.1 marked complete but contains `#[rotd_stub]` annotations (violation of R3)
- No TODOs found on main branch ✓
- Audit log shows 2 violations in past week

### 📈 Project Alignment
- Current sprint focuses on Phase 6 (automation features)
- Task 5.4 (low priority) was completed before 4.2 (urgent) - misalignment detected
- 8 of 12 planned tasks are on track for milestone

### ⚠️ Drift Signals
- Task 3.1 has been "in_progress" for 5 days without updates
- Test coverage dropped from 87% to 84% after merge
- 3 lessons learned entries have duplicate diagnosis patterns

### 🛠️ Corrective Actions
1. **Immediate**: Score missing tasks 4.1, 6.3, 7.2
2. **Priority**: Move task 4.2 to top of queue (urgent status)
3. **Compliance**: Remove stubs from task 6.1 or revert to in_progress
4. **Maintenance**: Deduplicate lessons_learned.jsonl entries
5. **Coverage**: Investigate coverage drop and add tests to restore 87% floor

### 📊 Health Score
- **Overall**: 7/10
- **Breakdown**:
  - Artifacts: 8/10 (missing some scores)
  - Compliance: 6/10 (stub violation)
  - Alignment: 7/10 (priority drift)
  - Momentum: 8/10 (good velocity)

### 🎯 Recommendations
- Implement automated priority checking in CI
- Add pre-commit hook to catch stub violations
- Schedule weekly review sessions on Mondays
- Consider raising coverage floor to 88% given current headroom
