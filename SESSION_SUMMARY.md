# ROTD Multi-Agent Update Session Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Multi-Agent Coordination System Implementation
- ✅ Created `src/coord.rs` module with complete coordination functionality
- ✅ Implemented all planned coordination commands:
  - `rotd coord claim` - Claim tasks with capability/priority filtering
  - `rotd coord release` - Release completed tasks
  - `rotd coord approve` - Approve tasks in review status
  - `rotd coord msg` - Log messages to coordination log
  - `rotd coord beat` - Update agent heartbeat
  - `rotd coord clean-stale` - Clean stale locks from timed-out agents
  - `rotd coord quota` - Track and update quota usage
  - `rotd coord ls` - List work registry

### 2. Core Features Implemented
- ✅ Agent heartbeat mechanism (60s intervals, 15min timeout)
- ✅ Task dependency validation during claiming
- ✅ Priority-aware task selection (urgent > high > medium > low)
- ✅ Atomic file locking for all coordination operations
- ✅ Coordination logging with timestamps and agent IDs
- ✅ Work registry with full task lifecycle tracking

### 3. Data Structures Created
- ✅ WorkRegistryTask with all required fields
- ✅ WorkStatus enum (unclaimed, claimed, blocked, review, done)
- ✅ TaskPriority enum (urgent, high, medium, low)
- ✅ DependencyMap for task dependencies
- ✅ QuotaTracker for usage tracking
- ✅ LockMetadata for lock diagnostics

### 4. Integration Points
- ✅ Added coord command to main CLI
- ✅ Support for both agent mode (JSON) and human mode output
- ✅ Environment variable support for ROTD_AGENT_ID
- ✅ Created initial registry and dependency map files

## Remaining Work

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. **Task 2.1**: Registry schema already supports new fields, but need to:
   - Add blocked status workflow
   - Implement review gate process
   - Add automated unblocking logic

2. **Task 2.2**: Priority claiming is implemented, but needs:
   - Tests for priority ordering
   - Documentation updates

3. **Task 2.3**: Dependency validation is implemented, but needs:
   - More sophisticated dependency resolution
   - Circular dependency detection

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Path-scoped file locking**: Prevent merge conflicts on source files
2. **Daily log rotation**: Automatic rotation at UTC midnight
3. **Automated release summaries**: Capture git diff stats on release

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
1. **Integration tests**: Multi-agent concurrent operation tests
2. **Documentation updates**: CLI command reference, agent prompts
3. **Schema validation**: Formal JSON schemas for all structures

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **File Locking**: Created generic `with_lock_result` function to return values from locked operations
2. **Borrowing Issues**: Resolved Rust borrow checker issues by pre-collecting task statuses
3. **UUID Generation**: Each agent gets a persistent UUID for identification
4. **Lock Files**: Contain metadata (holder, since) for debugging stale locks

## Next Steps

1. Create integration tests for concurrent agent operations
2. Update CLI documentation with coord command details
3. Implement remaining advanced features (log rotation, path locks)
4. Create example scripts for multi-agent workflows
5. Add capability-aware task routing from the spec addendum

The foundation for multi-agent ROTD is now in place and functional!
