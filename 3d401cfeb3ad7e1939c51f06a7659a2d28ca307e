# Repository Cleanup - Remove Obsolete Files

## Files Removed

### Root Directory Planning Documents
- CLI_COMMANDS.md (duplicate of docs/CLI_COMMANDS.md)
- ROTD_MAU_Plan.md (old planning document)
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md (temporary development file)
- TODO_1.2.1_TO_1.3.0.md (completed implementation plan)
- multiagent_coordination_details.md (superseded by implementation)
- multiagent_coordination_spec.md (superseded by implementation)

### Documentation Directory
- docs/CLI_COMMANDS.md (kept the main CLI_COMMANDS.md in root)
- docs/CLI_UPDATE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (implementation completed)
- docs/ROTD_UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md (superseded by built-in update commands)

### Scripts Directory
- scripts/manual_update.fish (superseded by 'rotd upgrade' command)
- scripts/manual_update.sh (superseded by 'rotd upgrade' command)

### Examples Directory
- examples/update_verification_checklist.md (obsolete, updates now automated)

### Temporary Files
- cleanup_workflow_runs.sh (temporary script, not part of core project)

## Impact

Repository is now cleaner with only essential documentation and no obsolete planning files. All superseded manual processes have been replaced by built-in CLI commands.
