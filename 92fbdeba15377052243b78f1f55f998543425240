# macOS Installer for GitHub Releases

Adds professional macOS installer (.pkg) to automated releases with universal binary support and proper PATH management.

## Features Added

- **Universal Binary** - Single installer works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- **Professional GUI** - Welcome screen, installation progress, and completion message
- **Automatic PATH Setup** - Adds /usr/local/bin to .zshrc and .bash_profile if needed
- **Update Handling** - Backs up existing installation and creates symlinks if needed
- **Version Validation** - Requires macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later
- **Beautiful Interface** - Styled HTML welcome and conclusion screens

## Technical Implementation

- Uses `lipo` to create universal binary from x86_64 and ARM64 builds
- `pkgbuild` creates component package with scripts
- `productbuild` creates final installer with distribution and resources
- Pre/post install scripts handle backup and PATH configuration
- Installs to `/usr/local/bin` with proper permissions
