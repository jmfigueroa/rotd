# Update Command Error Handling Improvements

## Problem Solved

The update command previously showed a generic error message:
```
! Could not fetch latest version.
```

This provided no useful information for troubleshooting network, API, or connectivity issues.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Error Messages
- **Network errors**: Specific timeout and connection error messages
- **HTTP errors**: Show actual status codes (404, 403, 500, etc.) with context
- **Parsing errors**: Clear messages about malformed API responses
- **Version parsing**: Better error messages for invalid release tags

### Verbose Troubleshooting
- Added `--verbose` flag support for troubleshooting guidance
- Common solutions for network issues, rate limiting, corporate firewalls
- Specific URL to test manually
- Proxy configuration suggestions

### Improved Agent Mode
- JSON error responses include specific error details
- Better error categorization (fetch-error, no-releases, etc.)

## Examples

**Before:**
```
! Could not fetch latest version.
```

**After (without verbose):**
```
! Could not fetch latest version.
Reason: GitHub API returned error 404: Not Found. This might be due to rate limiting or service issues.
```

**After (with --verbose):**
```
! Could not fetch latest version.
Reason: Request timed out after 10 seconds. Check your internet connection.

Common solutions:
- Check your internet connection
- Try again in a few minutes (GitHub API may be rate limited)
- Check if you can access https://api.github.com/repos/jmfigueroa/rotd/releases
- If behind a corporate firewall, you may need to configure proxy settings
```

## ROTD Task Reference

Task-ID: 1.3.0-update-error-handling

## Testing

Manual testing covered:
- Network timeout scenarios
- 404 errors for non-existent repositories
- Successful API calls with no releases
- Verbose vs non-verbose output formatting

## Impact

Users can now effectively troubleshoot update command failures instead of being stuck with generic error messages.
