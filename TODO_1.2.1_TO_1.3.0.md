- [ ] Ensure multi-agent coordination commands are accurate
- [ ] Review task lifecycle states for completeness

### 2.3 Document key insights from OVERVIEW
- [x] All artifacts stored in `.rotd/` directory
- [x] Task lifecycle: Scaffolded → In Progress → Complete/Blocked/Review
- [x] PSS scoring on 10-point scale with threshold ≥ 6
- [x] Multi-agent coordination uses environment variables

## Task 3: Ensure CLI is ready for 1.2.1 to 1.3.0 update

### 3.1 Test current CLI build and functionality
- [x] Run `cargo build --release` - **PASSED with warnings**
- [x] Run `cargo test` - **FAILED (1 test failure in completions)**

- [ ] Resolve compilation warnings (7 warnings about unused code)

### 3.2 Verify CLI readiness checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (currently failing)
- [ ] Clean build with no errors
- [ ] Core functionality working
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination features implemented
- [ ] Schema validation working

### 3.3 Address CLI preparation issues
- [ ] Fix test failure: `test_completions_command` expects "rotd" in output
- [ ] Clean up dead code warnings (unused constants and functions)
- [ ] Verify all multi-agent coordination commands are functional
- [ ] Test CLI with existing `.rotd` directory

## Task 4: Update version references to 1.3.0 everywhere applicable

### 4.1 Update core configuration files

- [ ] Update version in `src/config.rs` (line 13)
- [ ] Update version in `src/human.rs` (lines 186, 220, 304)
- [ ] Update version in `src/github.rs` (line 139)

### 4.2 Update script files
- [ ] Update `scripts/manual_update.sh` LATEST_VERSION to "1.3.0"
- [ ] Update `scripts/manual_update.fish` LATEST_VERSION to "1.3.0"

### 4.3 Update documentation files
- [ ] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to add v1.3.0 entry
- [ ] Update `docs/ROTD_UPDATE_PROTOCOL.md` version references
- [ ] Update version references in schema files (if any)

### 4.4 Update examples and schema
- [ ] Review and update version references in schema files
- [ ] Update examples that reference specific versions
- [ ] Update README_coordination.md if it has version references

### 4.5 Update version validation logic
- [ ] Update error message in `src/agent.rs` line 730 from "v1.2.1+" to "v1.3.0+"
- [ ] Update any version comparison logic
- [ ] Update migration/update logic to handle 1.2.1→1.3.0 transition

## Task 5: Update docs/GIT_COMMIT_RULES.md to use git notes instead of message body

### 5.1 Understand current git commit rules
- [x] Current format uses commit body for detailed notes
- [x] Example shows type, summary, and detailed body
- [x] Task-ID references are in commit body
- [x] Pre-commit hooks mentioned but not implemented

### 5.2 Design git notes approach
- [ ] Research git notes best practices
- [ ] Design new commit message format (header only)

- [ ] Fix CLI issues
- [ ] Update git commit rules
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

### 6.2 Stage and commit changes
- [ ] Review all modified files
- [ ] Stage relevant changes for commit
- [ ] Create commit using NEW git commit rules (notes-based)
- [ ] Add detailed information to git notes

### 6.3 Verify commit quality
- [ ] Check commit message follows new format
- [ ] Verify git notes contain appropriate detail
- [ ] Ensure Task-ID references are proper
- [ ] Run final tests before push

### 6.4 Push to repository
- [ ] Push commits to remote repository
- [ ] Verify git notes are properly handled
- [ ] Check that remote repository shows changes correctly
- [ ] Document any git notes configuration needed

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before marking this TODO complete, ensure:
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Clean build with no warnings (`cargo build --release`)
- [ ] Version updated consistently across all files
- [ ] Git commit rules properly updated
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] CLI functionality verified
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination features working
- [ ] All files properly committed with new git rules

## Critical Issues to Address

1. **Test Failure**: `test_completions_command` is failing - must fix before v1.3.0
2. **Dead Code**: 7 warnings about unused code - should clean up
3. **Version Consistency**: 15+ files need version updates
4. **Git Notes Implementation**: Need to research and implement properly
5. **Multi-agent Features**: Ensure all coordination features are working
