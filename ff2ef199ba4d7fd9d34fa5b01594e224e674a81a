# Separate Update and Upgrade Commands

Resolves confusion between updating project methodology and upgrading CLI binary by implementing distinct commands with different purposes.

## Changes Made

- Add `upgrade` command for CLI binary updates with automatic download and installation
- Modify `update` command to focus on ROTD project methodology updates
- Implement platform detection and binary downloading in GitHub module
- Add archive extraction support for tar.gz and zip files
- Add new dependencies: flate2, tar, zip for archive handling
- Create separate human and agent mode implementations for both commands
- Add comprehensive error handling and progress feedback

## Technical Details

- `update` command: Updates project ROTD version, backs up files, creates manifests
- `upgrade` command: Downloads platform-specific binary, extracts from archives, replaces current executable
- Both support --check flag for preview and --yes flag for automation
- Agent mode returns structured JSON for automation workflows

## Impact

Users no longer need to manually download CLI updates. The distinction between project updates and CLI upgrades is now clear and intuitive.

## ROTD Task Reference

Task-ID: 2.1

## Test Coverage
