# Compilation Warning Cleanup

## Problem Solved

The CLI was generating 7 compilation warnings on every build:

1. **Unstable name collisions** (2 warnings): `file.unlock()` method name conflicts
2. **Dead code warnings** (5 warnings): Unused coordination infrastructure code

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Unstable Name Collision Warnings

**Issue**: Method `unlock()` may be added to std library causing conflicts
```rust
file.unlock()?;  // Warning: unstable name collision
```

**Fix**: Used fully qualified syntax to be explicit about which unlock method to use
```rust
fs2::FileExt::unlock(&file)?;  // Clear, no ambiguity
```

**Locations**: `src/fs_ops.rs` lines 28 and 49

### 2. Dead Code Warnings

**Issue**: Multi-agent coordination code was implemented but not yet integrated:
- `COORDINATION_DIR` constant
- `ACTIVE_WORK_REGISTRY_FILE` constant
- `active_work_registry_path()` function
- `read_active_work_registry()` function
- `write_active_work_registry()` function

**Fix**: Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes instead of removing code
- Preserves infrastructure for future multi-agent features
- Eliminates compiler warnings
- Documentation indicates this is intentional placeholder code

## Testing

- ✅ Compilation: Clean build with 0 warnings
- ✅ Unit tests: 2/2 passing
- ✅ Integration tests: 8/8 passing
- ✅ Functionality: All CLI commands work as expected
- ✅ Error handling: Improved error messages preserved

## ROTD Task Reference

Task-ID: 1.3.0-cleanup-warnings

## Impact

Users now get clean builds without confusing warning messages. The coordination infrastructure remains in place for future development while not generating noise during compilation.
